### Features

**This pool is reegineered from sammy007 open-vapory-pool for efficiency and for better payment algorithm. This software is functional and tested and implemented in big Mining farms. Testing and bug submissions are still welcome!

*	Support for HTTP, SSL, Stratum, Stratum+SSL mining
*	Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward
*	Failover node instances: high availability built in (Any number of full nodes can be added to the configurations)
*	Modern beautiful Ember.js frontend for Individual coin statistics vs consolidated coin statistics
*	Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs
*	JSON-API for statistics, (Looking for contributor to build app for the pool)
*	Dynamic PPLNS block reward (*New)

### How it is different from sammy007 version

*	Reengineered most of the code for efficiency and Scaling
*	New Dynamic PPLNS Reward System
*	Integration with the Exchange to get real-time conversion between crypto and fiat.
*	The Network fees can be configured to be withheld for every transfers. 
*	The gas can be set as Auto and made to deduct automatically or can be fixed by the pool operator
*	Many parameters configurable using config file
*	Nicehash support *Not tested
*	SSL Support built-in
*	Very attractive frontend with more detailed statistics

### Architecture

![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vapory-mining/vapash-mining-pool/master/images/Architecture.PNG)


### Building on Linux

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.9 but <1.10 ( For 1.11 Refer branches)
  * gvap or parity
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0
  * nodejs >= 4 LTS
  * nginx

**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.**

First install  [go-vapory](https://github.com/vapory/go-vapory/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Ubuntu).

Clone & compile:

    git config --global http.https://gopkg.in.followRedirects true
    git clone https://github.com/vapory-mining/vapash-mining-pool.git
    <Change the branch>
    git pull
    cd open-vapory-pool
    make

Install redis-server.


### Building Frontend

There are 2 front end application. 
* One for showing the consolidated view of different pool statistics
* Another for single coin frontend.

You may choose your desired one
To show the statistics for one coin (Front end api) : https://github.com/techievee/statistics_api 
To show the consolidated statistics for all the coins that were implemented : https://github.com/techievee/generalapi

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.
Please refer the frontend application Readme.md for more information. Those frontend are not compliant to sammy007 versions

### DPPLNS ALGORITHM (NEW) 

The algorithm explanation is as follows

* CALCULATING THE LAST N VALUE
```javascript
Check whether blockchainnode present
If present
	Calulcate the current network difficulty
	Calulate the network difficulty *2
	Calculate the N value by (2* Network difficulty)/ Share difficulty
 	Set the last N value in the statistics hash key
Else
	Fix the predetermined standard ‘N’ value from the block chain	
```
Space : O(1)	
RunTime : O(1)

* ADJUSTING THE ‘N’ SHARES
```javascript
Get the current last N value from the lastNshares Hash
Get the current count of lastNshares list
If lastNShare< count
	Loop(count - lastNshare )
		Pop lastNShare
		Decrement the miners share count from the lastN value
    		Decrement the total shares count
       end
```

Space : O(1)	
RunTime : O(N)

* NEW SHARE SUBMISSION
```javascript
Push the value of miners address into the last shares list
Increment the current round shares by 1
Increment the round shares value by 1
Increment the miners shares by 1
Check if new block found
If found
	Run the New block function
Else
Adjust the value of ‘N’ shares
```

Space : O(1)	
RunTime : O(1)

* REWARD CALUCLATION USING DPPLNS
```javascript
Loop(lastNshare )
		Get the miners address from list
Increment the local miners current round share 
       End
Loop(miners of current round)
		Percentage= minersshare / current round share
End
```

Space : O(N)	
RunTime : O(N)


### Configuration Documentation- Applies to all brnanches

Configuration is actually simple, just read it twice and think twice before changing defaults.
